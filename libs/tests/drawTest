-- the 'draw' import with a monitor and the
-- glasses terminal

-- As a side note, the (x, y) coordinate system
-- is slightly different between the two. Monitors
-- and terminals use each character / line as its
-- unit measurement wheras the glasses terminal seems
-- to work in pixel measurements
